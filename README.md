# connect-pi
A website I built for my fraternity as a more centralized way of finding and contacting active and alumni brothers.


To test and view code, ```git clone https://github.com/dascolt1/connect-pi/``` and then ```cd connect-pi``` and then ```npm run dev```
Open up your browser of choice and navigate to ```localhost:3000``` and you'll be redirected to the login page.

Since this is an active website, for demo purposes contact me directly.
