# connect-pi
A website I built for my fraternity as a more centralized way of finding and contacting active and alumni brothers.
It was built using Handlebars.js as a templating engine, with Node.JS and Express in the backend.  I am currently using MongoDB as my database management system and handled user authorization with Passport.js. 
The front end was built using Bootstrap 3 and is fully responsive and compatible on all screen sizes and devices.


To test and view code in action, ```git clone https://github.com/dascolt1/connect-pi/```, ```cd connect-pi```, type ```npm init``` and then ```npm run dev```.
Open up your browser of choice and navigate to ```localhost:3000``` and you'll be redirected to the login page.

Since this is an active website, for demo purposes, contact me directly.
